## Project Title
Bikeshare Project

## Description
Exploring bikeshare data.
In this project, we use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

This is done using Python 
A script is used that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Files used
